# Auto Scaling the VM-Series-firewall on Azure

Palo Alto Networks now provides templates to help you deploy an auto-scaling tier of VM-Series firewalls
using several Azure services such as Virtual Machine Scale Sets, Application Insights, Azure Load Balancers,
Azure functions, Panorama and the Panorama plugin for Azure, and the VM-Series automation capabilities
including the PAN-OS API and bootstrapping. The templates allow you to leverage the scalability features
on Azure that are designed to manage sudden surges in demand for application workload resources by
independently scaling the VM-Series firewalls with the changing workloads.

The deployment guide can be found 
[HERE](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/vm-series/9-0/vm-series-deployment/set-up-the-vm-series-firewall-on-azure/autoscaling-the-vm-series-firewall-on-azure.html#)  

**Panorama Config File**   
a sample Panorama configuration file has been included in this GitHub repository   
user: pandemo pwd: Dem0pa$$w0rd     

**Gotchas**  
- Be sure you place the Virtual Router in the Template Stack NOT the template   
- Minimum of PAN-OS 8.1.8 for Panorama is required  
- If Hub is deployed last you must manually peer the hub with the app template  
- Because we use VNet Peering be sure none of your virtual network subnets overlap  
- ***Be sure to configure health probes for the Load Balancers in Panorama for the Hub and Inbound template.***
